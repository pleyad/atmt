# Assignment 4: Improving Beam Search

In this assignment we use fr-en data from the Tatoeba
corpus (same as in assignment 3)

In this assignment, you do NOT need to train a new model. Instead, we focus on decoding with beam search.

As a baseline model, you can take the baseline used for assignment 3 or your best performing model (that you trained yourself) from assignment 3.
